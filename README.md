# Rapid Prototyping

Welcome to the **rapid-prototyping** repository! This is a space where new ideas in Python or related languages can be quickly tested and experimented with. If any idea shows promise, it can be further developed in separate repositories.

## Ideas

### Anki
- Automatically create and organize a deck based on characters the user has already seen.

**Further Development**
- Create a Python/Qt GUI for a more user-friendly interface.
- Complete the reference project.
- Add support for downloading webpages and opening them using xdg-open.

**Status**
This idea has been implemented as an Android Studio project. Please refer to the "reference" folder for more details.

### Extended Browsing
Create a new user interface for researching webpages as a project.

The goal is to enable the user to find specific information or gather materials on a particular subject from the web. The concept includes a "restore session" feature similar to that found in Firefox, allowing users to revisit previous browsing sessions.

Specific Example:
- Researching AWS training certifications.
  - Identify the available certifications and provide links to them.
  - Organize related materials with traceability between webpages.
    - Example: Source webpage with all certifications -> AWS developer certification -> ...

Additional Features:
- Take notes on a webpage and record audio.

**Functionality**
- Export to Markdown format.
- Save and categorize pages, organizing them in terms of frequency.

### Numberplate Categorization
A simple project to passively read number plates and related data from a car dashcam.

Use Cases:
- Identify regular commuters to work and track their timings.
- Follow up on possible accidents or car scrapes that occurred overnight.

### RV1126 Doorway Lock
Create an Android application for controlling a doorway lock using the native environment of the RV1126 platform.

### C++ Project
- Develop a C++ socket API for general use.
- Implement AI detection using the SigmaStar platform.
